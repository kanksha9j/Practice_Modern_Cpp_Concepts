Uncomment the 'main()' function to run a specific concept.

These practice programs are based on exercises from the Udemy course  
["Complete Modern C++ (C++11/14/17)"](https://www.udemy.com/course/beg-modern-cpp/)  
I have implemented the examples in my own style with comments and explanations to reinforce learning.
